## What is Decoupled Frontend Infrastructure?

Publive's Decoupled Frontend Infrastructure lets you build **your own website** (Next.js, custom UI, custom logic) while using **Publive CMS** solely for content management and publishing.

### Why Use Decoupled Infrastructure

```

### Data Flow

1. **Content Creation**: Editors publish content in Publive CMS
2. **API Exposure**: CMS exposes content via REST/GraphQL APIs
3. **Frontend Rendering**: Your Next.js app fetches and renders content
4. **Deployment**: Changes pushed to GitHub trigger automatic deployments

## Publisher Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onboarding">
    Publive engineers provide:
    - Publisher credentials (API keys and secrets)
    - GitHub repository access with target branches
    - Live app URL for production environment
    
    ```bash
    # Credentials provided during onboarding
    PUBLISHER_ID=your-publisher-id
    API_KEY=your-api-key
    API_SECRET=your-api-secret
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Custom Development">
    Build your custom website with full ownership of:
    - Code and business logic
    - UI/UX design
    - Application structure
    - Feature implementation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deployment">
    Push changes to GitHub → CI/CD automatically deploys to your live environment
    
    <Note>
    Full CI/CD documentation available in [Deployment Guide](/guides/deployment)
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go Live">
    Your website is accessible via the provided URL and ready to serve traffic
  </Step>
</Steps>
