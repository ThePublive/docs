Publive supports configurable approval workflows for content publishing. This guide covers how to implement approval flows using the CMS API.

## Content Statuses

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `Draft` | Work in progress, not visible to public |
| `Approval Pending` | Submitted for review |
| `Published` | Live and publicly accessible |
| `Scheduled` | Will be published at a future date/time |

## Basic Approval Flow

### 1. Author Creates Draft

The content creator writes the article and saves as draft.

### 2. Author Submits for Review

Update the post status to `Approval Pending`:

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  'https://cms.thepublive.com/publisher/123/post/{id}/' \
  -H 'username: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'password: YOUR_API_SECRET' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": "Approval Pending"}'
```

### 3. Editor Reviews and Approves

The editor can either publish or reject:

```bash
# Approve and publish
curl -X PATCH ... -d '{"status": "Published"}'

# Reject back to draft
curl -X PATCH ... -d '{"status": "Draft"}'
```

### 4. Schedule for Later (Optional)

Instead of immediate publishing, schedule for a future time:

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  'https://cms.thepublive.com/publisher/123/post/{id}/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": "Scheduled",
    "scheduled_at": "2026-03-01T09:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## Backdated Publishing

For content that needs a custom publication date (e.g., migrated content):

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  'https://cms.thepublive.com/publisher/123/post/{id}/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": "Published",
    "custom_published_at": "2025-12-15T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

<Info>
The `published_post` field in the post response references the live version, while edits can be made to the draft version independently.
