Publive includes built-in AI capabilities to help content teams work more efficiently.

## Auto Tag Suggestions

When creating or editing a post, Publive's AI analyzes the content and suggests relevant tags. This helps with:

- Consistent content categorization
- Improved content discovery
- Reduced manual tagging effort

Tags are suggested based on content analysis and can be accepted or dismissed by editors.

## SEO Scoring

Posts automatically receive an `seo_score` based on:

| Factor | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `seo_keyphrase` usage | Focus keyword density and placement |
| `short_description` | Meta description quality and length |
| `meta_title` | Title tag optimization |
| Content length | `word_count` relative to post type |
| Heading structure | Proper H1-H6 hierarchy in content |

Access the SEO score via the CMS API:

```json
{
  "id": 50123,
  "seo_score": 85,
  "seo_keyphrase": "union budget 2026"
}
```

## Plagiarism Detection

Publive checks content for plagiarism before publication, helping maintain editorial integrity and avoid copyright issues.

## Indian Language Support

AI features support Indian languages for:

- Tag suggestions in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and other Indian languages
- Content analysis for non-English articles
- Multi-language SEO optimization

The `language_code` field in posts indicates the content language:

```json
{
  "language_code": "hi",
  "title": "..."
}
```

AI-powered content recommendations help:

- Suggest related articles for readers
- Identify content gaps in your coverage
