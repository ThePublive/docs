## Migrating from Deprecated CDS Endpoints

Several single-purpose CDS endpoints have been deprecated in favor of the unified [Post Listing](/api-reference/content-delivery/post-listing) endpoint with query filters.

### Posts by Category

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /posts_by_category/100/

# After
GET /posts/?categories.id__eq=100
```

### Posts by Tag

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /posts_by_tag/500/

# After
GET /posts/?tags.id__eq=500
```

### Posts by Author

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /posts_by_author/1/

# After
GET /posts/?contributors.id__eq=1
```

### Latest Posts by Type

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /latest-posts/Article/

# After
GET /posts/?type__eq=Article&sort_by=created_at&sort_order=desc
```

### Homepage

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /homepage/

# After
GET /posts/?limit=20&sort_by=created_at&sort_order=desc
```

### Search

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /search/?q=budget

# After
GET /posts/?title__contains=budget
```

### Post by Slug

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /posts_by_slug/my-article-slug/

# After
GET /post/my-article-slug/
```

### Related Posts

```bash
# Before (deprecated)
GET /related-posts/12345/

# After (filter by same primary category)
GET /posts/?primary_category.id__eq=100&limit=5
```

## Benefits of Migration

The new `/posts/` endpoint provides:

- **Advanced filtering** with operators (`__eq`, `__contains`, `__in`, `__gte`, `__lte`)
- **Sorting** with `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters
- **Combined filters** for complex queries
- **Consistent pagination** across all queries
- **Cache-Tags** for CDN integration

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Identify all deprecated endpoint calls in your codebase
- [ ] Replace each with the equivalent `/posts/` query
- [ ] Test that response data matches expected format
- [ ] Update any response parsing (field names are consistent)
- [ ] Monitor for deprecation warnings in API responses
