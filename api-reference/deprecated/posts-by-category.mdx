<Warning>
**Deprecated:** Use `/posts/?categories.id__eq={category_id}` instead. See [Post Listing](/api-reference/content-delivery/post-listing).

`GET` `https://cds.thepublive.com/publisher/{publisher_id}/posts_by_category/{category_id}/`

Returns posts belonging to a specific category.

#### Migration

```bash
# Old (deprecated)
GET /posts_by_category/100/

# New (recommended)
GET /posts/?categories.id__eq=100
```

The new endpoint supports additional filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
