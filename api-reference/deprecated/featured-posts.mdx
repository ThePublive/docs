# Featured Posts

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Deprecated:** This endpoint has no direct replacement. Use the [Post Listing](../content-delivery/post-listing.md) endpoint with appropriate filters.
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:blue;">`GET`</mark> `https://cds.thepublive.com/publisher/{publisher_id}/featured-posts/`

Returns featured/highlighted posts.

#### Migration

Use the Post Listing endpoint with sorting and filtering to curate featured content:

```bash
GET /posts/?sort_by=created_at&sort_order=desc&limit=5
```
