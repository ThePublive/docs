---

The Content Management Service (CMS) provides full CRUD access to your content. Use these APIs to create, update, retrieve, and delete posts, categories, tags, and media programmatically.

**Base URL:** `https://cms.thepublive.com/publisher/{publisher_id}/`

<Info>
All CMS endpoints require `username` and `password` authentication headers, plus `Content-Type: application/json` for POST and PATCH requests.

## Resources

| Resource | Endpoints | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| [Categories](/api-reference/content-management/categories) | List, Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete | Manage content categories |
| [Tags](/api-reference/content-management/tags) | List, Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete | Manage content tags |
| [Posts](/api-reference/content-management/posts) | List, Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete | Manage articles, videos, galleries, and more |
| [Media Library](/api-reference/content-management/media) | List, Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete | Manage images, videos, and files |

## Common Patterns

### Authentication

```bash
-H 'username: YOUR_API_KEY'
-H 'password: YOUR_API_SECRET'
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Pagination

All list endpoints return paginated results:

```json
{
  "count": 245,
  "next": "https://cms.thepublive.com/publisher/123/category/?page=2&limit=10",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [...]
}
```

| Parameter | Default | Max |
| --------- | ------- | --- |
| `page` | 1 | 1000 |
| `limit` | 10 | 50 |

### Update Method

All update endpoints use **PATCH** (partial update). You only need to send the fields you want to change.

### Success Responses

| Operation | Status | Message |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Create | 201 | "Created Successfully" |
| Update | 200 | "Updated Successfully" |
| Delete | 200 | "Deleted successfully!" |
